Ideas to implement (much) later:

1. show possible completed word on miss
2. have a post-game screen with all the completed words, and a few possible words for 'missed words'.
  - link to definitions for these words
3. ramp up the speed over time so that games do not last forever
4. create a play-through tutorial

5. Delete inactive anonymous users from Auth if they have been inactive for a long time
  - this is fairly indepth and will require maintaining user time-stamps (presumably for most recent activity) and uids in the database. Then with that info if the time-stamp is old enough, delete the user using firebase admin sdk

Ideas to implement today(ish):
1. fun anonymous user names -- done!
