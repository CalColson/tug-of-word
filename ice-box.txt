Ideas to implement (much) later:

1. show possible completed word on miss
2. have a post-game screen with all the completed words, and a few possible words for 'missed words'.
  - link to definitions for these words
3. ramp up the speed over time so that games do not last forever
4. create a play-through tutorial
